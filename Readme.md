Hello there, THis site is a music player site, this site was made with the intention of listening to my favourite music without the ads and unwanted sugesstions. \
You can try out this site by downloading the files and running the Music.html file, ensure you have an internet connection to be able to load the fonts and icons. \
I'm open to sugesstions and criticism as it will only make it better.

Changelog :-

    27/10/23 : 
        V0.1
            -> made a change to the word changer to add a class and data-file-name value to the audio
            -> made the audio of the previous set to zero when another track starts playing
            -> added 3 songs.


The Wordchanger file :-\
    As the name might give a hint, it is a code i wrote that helps automate the process of creating the html and javascript code for the site.\
        -> The first version i inputted names of class,div,title,audio file to help generate the code.\
        -> The second version i wrote code that was able to grab the first letter of each word that helped in creating the id for the elements.\
        -> The third and latest version is where i input the name of the file, the audio number and how many words is the title of the song.\
        -> I plan to keep upgrading features to make the process seamless, I plan to make it so that with only 1 input it can help generate the code.

Dev notes / ideas:\
removed the interval for the minute part, made it a part of the second timer.\
an issue is there where the minute changes when the minute changes 1 second before it's supposed to.\
removed 16 songs from the main list because it became too much to handle with the amount of changes i am making.\
there are 4 songs with which i am testing right now and once i reach a stable version where i can easily change all the stuff without going through each one of them.\
i dont want it to be perfect i just need it to be efficient.\
chane the word changer document to make it compatible with new format
