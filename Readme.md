Hello there, THis site is a music player site, this site was made with the intention of listening to my favourite music without the ads and unwanted sugesstions.
You can try out this site by downloading the files and running the Music.html file, ensure you have an internet connection to be able to load the fonts and icons.
I'm open to sugesstions and criticism as it will only make it better.
