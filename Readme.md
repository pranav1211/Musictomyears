Hello there, THis site is a music player site, this site was made with the intention of listening to my favourite music without the ads and unwanted sugesstions. \
You can try out this site by downloading the files and running the Music.html file, ensure you have an internet connection to be able to load the fonts and icons. \
I'm open to sugesstions and criticism as it will only make it better.

The Wordchanger file :-\
    As the name might give a hint, it is a code i wrote that helps automate the process of creating the html and javascript code for the site.\
        -> The first version i inputted names of class,div,title,audio file to help generate the code.\
        -> The second version i wrote code that was able to grab the first letter of each word that helped in creating the id for the elements.\
        -> The third and latest version is where i input the name of the file, the audio number and how many words is the title of the song.\
        -> I plan to keep upgrading features to make the process seamless, I plan to make it so that with only 1 input it can help generate the code.

Dev notes / ideas:\

5/12/23 \
removed the interval for the minute part, made it a part of the second timer.\
an issue is there where the minute changes when the minute changes 1 second before it's supposed to.\
removed 16 songs from the main list because it became too much to handle with the amount of changes i am making.\
there are 4 songs with which i am testing right now and once i reach a stable version where i can easily change all the stuff without going through each one of them.\
i dont want it to be perfect i just need it to be efficient.\
chane the word changer document to make it compatible with new format.

made the fix of the minute part starting on 59 seconds, realised that it was a scope issue.
