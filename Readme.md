The Wordchanger file :-\
    As the name might give a hint, it is a code i wrote that helps automate the process of creating the html and javascript code for the site.\
        -> The first version i inputted names of class,div,title,audio file to help generate the code.\
        -> The second version i wrote code that was able to grab the first letter of each word that helped in creating the id for the elements.\
        -> The third and latest version is where i input the name of the file, the audio number and how many words is the title of the song.\
        -> I plan to keep upgrading features to make the process seamless, I plan to make it so that with only 1 input it can help generate the code.

Dev notes / ideas:

5/12/23 
->removed the interval for the minute part, made it a part of the second timer.\
->an issue is there where the minute changes when the minute changes 1 second before it's supposed to.\
->removed 16 songs from the main list because it became too much to handle with the amount of changes i am making.\
->there are 4 songs with which i am testing right now and once i reach a stable version where i can easily change all the stuff without going through each one of them.\
->i dont want it to be perfect i just need it to be efficient.\
->have to change the word changer document to make it compatible with new format.

18/12/23

->made the fix of the minute part starting on 59 seconds, realised that it was a scope issue.\
->added some empty buttons, will need a way to iterate in the future for next and shuffle.\
->maybe JSON or a JS object can use the song-id part.

20/12/23 

->have to work on the loop button to make it loop for either the whole playlist or just and individual song. \
->have to enter song data into json file. look into SQLlite.\
->have to work on the shuffle button
->have to work on the next and previous song previous song button, for previous song button set time to 1 second and also do the clear interval and change content in div for it.
