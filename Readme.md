Hello there, THis site is a music player site, this site was made with the intention of listening to my favourite music without the ads and unwanted sugesstions.
You can try out this site by downloading the files and running the Music.html file, ensure you have an internet connection to be able to load the fonts and icons.
I'm open to sugesstions and criticism as it will only make it better.

Changelog :-

    27/10/23 : 
        V0.1
            -> made a change to the word changer to add a class and data-file-name value to the audio
            -> made the audio of the previous set to zero when another track starts playing
            -> added 3 songs.


The Wordchanger file - As the name might give a hint, it is a code i wrote that helps automate the process of creating the html and javascript code for the site.
    The first version i inputted names of class,div,title,audio file to help generate the code.
    The second version i wrote code that was able to grab the first letter of each word that helped in creating the id for the elements.
    The third and latest version is where i input the name of the file, the audio number and how many words is the title of the song.
    I plan to keep upgrading features to make the process seamless, I plan to make it so that with only 1 input it can help generate the code.
